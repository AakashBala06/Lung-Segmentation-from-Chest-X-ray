# Lung Segmentation from Chest X-ray

This project demonstrates a fundamental biomedical image processing technique using MATLAB: segmenting the lung region from a frontal chest X-ray. The process leverages classic image enhancement and thresholding operations to isolate regions of interest, simulating the initial steps used in many real-world diagnostic imaging and AI systems.

## üñºÔ∏è Sample Output

*The blue overlay highlights the lung region segmented from the original chest X-ray image.*


## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

1. Open MATLAB Online or desktop version with the Image Processing Toolbox.
2. Upload all files to your working directory.
3. Run the script `segment_xray.m`.
4. The segmented lung image will display and be saved as `segmented_output.png`.
